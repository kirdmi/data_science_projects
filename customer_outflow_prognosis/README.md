# Customer Churn Prediction

The bank is experiencing monthly customer churn, which, despite initially appearing small in volume, has a noticeable impact over time. To mitigate this issue, it has been determined that retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

The task at hand is to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank, utilizing historical data on customer behavior. A model needs to be built with the primary objective of achieving the highest F1-measure value, with a target metric value of 0.59. Additionally, an AUC-ROC measurement will be used to further enhance the predictive performance.

The data source for this task is available at https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling, and the following libraries will be utilized: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, and re. The results of this predictive modeling effort will aid the bank in proactively identifying customers at risk of churning and taking appropriate measures to retain them.
