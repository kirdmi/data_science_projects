# Car Cost Estimation

A car sales service is currently working on an application with the aim of attracting customers. The application will provide users with the ability to determine the market value of their cars. Historical data, including technical specifications and prices, is available for this purpose. The development of a predictive model is essential to accurately estimate the cost of a car.

Key considerations for this project include:

    Ensuring high-quality prediction results
    Optimizing prediction speed for efficient performance
    Reducing model training time for improved productivity

Libraries that will be utilized in this project include pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, and lightgbm.
