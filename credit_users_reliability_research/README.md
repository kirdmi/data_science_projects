#  Reliability of Borrowers: Hypothesis Testing

The credit department of a bank has assigned a task to investigate whether the marital status and the number of children of a borrower have any impact on their ability to repay loans on time.

The following hypotheses will be tested as part of the task:

    Hypothesis 1: The presence and number of children are correlated with the timely repayment of loans.
    Hypothesis 2: Marital status is correlated with the timely repayment of loans.
    Hypothesis 3: The level of income is correlated with the timely repayment of loans.
    Hypothesis 4: The stated objectives of the loan are correlated with the timely repayment of loans.

To conduct the analysis, libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn will be utilized. The results of this research will provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the reliability of borrowers in repaying loans on time, aiding the credit department in making informed decisions and mitigating risks associated with loan default.
