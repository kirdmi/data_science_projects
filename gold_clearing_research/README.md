# Gold Recovery Prediction from Ore

As part of the company's efforts to enhance the efficiency of industrial enterprises, a machine learning model is required to be prototyped. The primary objective of this model is to predict the recovery factor of gold from gold ore.

The proposed model is expected to serve as an auxiliary tool for optimizing production processes, thereby minimizing losses. The utilization of this predictive model will enable the company to make informed decisions and implement appropriate strategies to maximize gold recovery rates from ore.

The libraries to be employed in this prototype development include pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, and re, which will aid in data analysis, visualization, and model training. This project has the potential to significantly contribute to the company's efforts in improving the efficiency of gold extraction processes and increasing overall profitability.
