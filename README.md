##  [Reliability of Borrowers: Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/kirdmi/data_science_projects/tree/main/credit_users_reliability_research)

The credit department of a bank has assigned a task to investigate whether the marital status and the number of children of a borrower have any impact on their ability to repay loans on time.

The following hypotheses will be tested as part of the task:

- Hypothesis 1: The presence and number of children are correlated with the timely repayment of loans.
    
- Hypothesis 2: Marital status is correlated with the timely repayment of loans.
    
- Hypothesis 3: The level of income is correlated with the timely repayment of loans.
    
- Hypothesis 4: The stated objectives of the loan are correlated with the timely repayment of loans.

To conduct the analysis, libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn will be utilized. The results of this research will provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the reliability of borrowers in repaying loans on time, aiding the credit department in making informed decisions and mitigating risks associated with loan default.

## [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/kirdmi/data_science_projects/tree/main/customer_outflow_prognosis)

The bank is experiencing monthly customer churn, which, despite initially appearing small in volume, has a noticeable impact over time. To mitigate this issue, it has been determined that retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

The task at hand is to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank, utilizing historical data on customer behavior. A model needs to be built with the primary objective of achieving the highest F1-measure value, with a target metric value of 0.59. Additionally, an AUC-ROC measurement will be used to further enhance the predictive performance.

The data source for this task is available at https://www.kaggle.com/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling, and the following libraries will be utilized: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, and re. The results of this predictive modeling effort will aid the bank in proactively identifying customers at risk of churning and taking appropriate measures to retain them.

## [Gold Recovery Prediction from Ore](https://github.com/kirdmi/data_science_projects/tree/main/gold_clearing_research)

As part of the company's efforts to enhance the efficiency of industrial enterprises, a machine learning model is required to be prototyped. The primary objective of this model is to predict the recovery factor of gold from gold ore.

The proposed model is expected to serve as an auxiliary tool for optimizing production processes, thereby minimizing losses. The utilization of this predictive model will enable the company to make informed decisions and implement appropriate strategies to maximize gold recovery rates from ore.

The libraries to be employed in this prototype development include pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, and re, which will aid in data analysis, visualization, and model training.
