# Age Determination from Customer Photos

A supermarket is implementing a computer vision system in its daily operations to process customer photos captured at the checkout area, with the goal of determining the age of customers.

This system opens up new possibilities, including:

    Analyzing the purchased goods to make targeted offers based on customer preferences.
    Enforcing age restrictions for the sale of alcohol and tobacco-containing products.

As part of this project, a machine learning model will be developed to accurately estimate the age of a person from their photo.

The libraries to be used in this project include tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, which will enable data processing, model development, and visualization. The successful implementation of this project has the potential to enhance customer profiling, improve targeted marketing strategies, and ensure compliance with age restrictions for certain products in the supermarket.
