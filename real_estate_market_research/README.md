# Study of Apartment Ads:

Data from the Ya.Nedvizhimost service, which is an aggregator of ads for the sale of apartments, is available for analysis.

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can determine the market value of various real estate objects. The challenge is to identify parameters that can be used to create an automated system capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activities in the data.

The available data consists of two types - user-entered data and automatically obtained data based on cartographic information.

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy.
