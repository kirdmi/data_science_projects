# Tariff Recommendation

Access has collected data on customer behavior related to switching to different tariffs. The goal is to create a classification model that can be used to recommend the most suitable tariff for customers. The model needs to achieve the highest possible accuracy, with a minimum target value of 0.75 for this parameter.

Libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and scikit-learn will be used to build and evaluate the classification model, ensuring that it meets the accuracy requirement while effectively recommending appropriate tariffs to customers.
